# Note Taker
  

  ## Description

  This application allows the creation and deletion of notes online. The notes are stored in .json file with the application. This application was created to demonstrate my ability to use Express.js routes, and manipulating files systems. While creating this application, I gained a greater understanding of Express.js, routes, deploying to Heroku, and found gaps in my general JavaScript knowledge that have been filled.
